<p>The techniques for building applications have changed dramatically in the last <br />

few years. Gone are the days of single-tier, battle-ship gray, boring user <br />

interfaces. Users demand that your applications (or portions) run on more than <br />

one device. This session will take you on a tour of how you should be architecting your application by breaking it up into services. You will learn how <br />

to create your business rules and data layer as a service. This seminar will <br />

assume you have some knowledge of .NET but have been developing <br />

applications the old way and you are now looking to see how to use WCF and <br />

the Model-View-View-Model (MVVM) design pattern to create applications that <br />

can be run one more than one user interface platform. This session has many <br />

demonstrations and you will be led step-by-step through the code. You will walk <br />

away with a sample set of services that run on Silverlight, Windows Forms, <br />

WPF, Windows Phone and ASP.NET.</p>
